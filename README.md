# EEE3088F-Project
# EEE3088F Project: Power Subsystem for Micro Mouse Robot

## üìå Introduction

This project forms part of the EEE3088F course, focusing on the design and development of the **power subsystem** for a maze-solving robot known as a **micro mouse**. The micro mouse achieves autonomous navigation through a system modularized into:

- Processor
- Motherboard
- Sensing
- Power

Our responsibility lies in the **Power Module**, which ensures reliable power delivery to all electronic components of the micro mouse.

## ‚öôÔ∏è 1. Problem Description

The micro mouse requires a stable and efficient power supply to drive its operations, which include movement, sensing, and computation. This project involves designing a power module capable of:

- Powering **four DC motors**
- Integrating **USB-C** for **9V output**
- Regulating **3.3V and 5V power rails**
- Enabling **dual battery charging modes**

All of this must be done while maintaining modular compatibility with the rest of the micro mouse system.

## üìê 2. Scope and Limitations

- **Scope**:  
  This project is limited to the **power subsystem only**. However, the design must remain compatible with the processor, motherboard, and sensing modules.

- **Constraints**:
  - Strict budget limit of **$70**
  - **No use of breadboard-based components**
  - Must meet **PCB dimension limits**: `82mm x 60mm`
  - Requires **individual reports** despite collaborative PCB design
  - PCB must be designed from scratch using **permitted components only**
